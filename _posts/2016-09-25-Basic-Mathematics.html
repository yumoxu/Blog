<h2>Probability<h2>
<p>Probability can be used for 2 types of problems</p>
    <li>Generation/prediction: Reasoning from causes to effects</li>
    <li>Inference. Reasoning from effects to causes.</li>

<h2>The phrase “at random”</h2>
<p>The phrase “at random” is ambiguous: technically, it just means there is some randomness involved, not necessarily that all outcomes are equally likely.</p>

<h2>Geometric distribution</h2>
<p>Definition: $P(X=x) = (1-p)^{n-1} p$</p>
<p>It is often referred as a “family” of distributions because the formula contains a parameter $p$.</p>
<p>Geometric distribution characterize: we repeat some random experiment until we succeed, and we are only interested in how long it will take to succeed.</p>

<h2>Bionomial distribution \& multinomial distribution</h2>
<h3>Bionomial distribution</h3>
<p>If we have a Bernoulli variable $X$ and we repeatedly sample values from $P(X)$ (e.g., ﬂip a coin many times), we will get some number of 1’s (heads) and some number of 0’s (tails). The binomial distribution with parameters $p$ and $n$ describes the probability of getting a certain number of 1’s out of a total of $n$ samples when the probability of a 1 on a single sample is $p$.</p>
<h3>Multinomial distribution</h3>
<p>Extension: the “coin” has more than two outcomes.</p>

<h2>Poisson distribution</h2>
<p>
Thing happens $λ$ times within a certain ﬁxed period of time, but the intervals between the occurrences are random.
