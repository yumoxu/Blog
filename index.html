<p>Hi, this is Yumo XU. I am currently a postgradute student studying Artificial Intelligence (natural language processing specialism) in the University of Edinburgh.<br />
Before starting my postgraduate study, I have obtained my bachelor degree in School of Information Management, University of International Business and Economics (UIBE). I have also worked as an intern in IBM CDL as well as Oracle.<br />
I am interested in the combination of probabilistic graphic models (PGMs) and deep learning models, epecially the applications in the semantics field, such as lexical semantics, word disambiguation, sentiment analysis, etc.<br />
You can contact me through kevin.xym@outlook.com.
