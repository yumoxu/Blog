<p>Hi, this is Yumo XU. I am currently a postgradute student studying Artificial Intelligence (natural language processing specialism) in the University of Edinburgh.<br />
Before the persuit of the master degree, I got my bachelor degree in School of Information Management, University of International Business and Economics (UIBE), and worked in IBM China Development Lab and Oracle as an intern.<br />
I am interested in the combination of probabilistic graphic models (PGMs) and deep learning models, epecially in the semantics field, such as lexical semantics, word disambiguation, etc.<br />
