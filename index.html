<p>Hi, this is Yumo XU. I am currently a postgradute student studying Artificial Intelligence (natural language processing specialism) at the University of Edinburgh.<br />
Before starting my postgraduate study, I have obtained my bachelor degree at School of Informatics, University of International Business and Economics (UIBE). I have also worked as an intern in IBM CDL as well as Oracle.<br />
I am interested in the combination of probabilistic graphic models (PGMs) and deep learning models, epecially the applications in the semantics field, such as distributional semantics, compositional semantics, word disambiguation (WSD), sentiment analysis (SA), etc.<br />
You can contact me through kevin.xym@outlook.com.
